* support for fluent interface

We now support fluent interfaces, when generating setters you will be asked what to do.
You can disable or enable this feature in the settings. see Readme.md for information


If you have any questions or found a bug fell free to contact me at nuno@francodacosta.com

For bugs open an issue on github https://github.com/francodacosta/sublime-php-getters-setters/issues

Hope you enjoy it.
